The blockchain ecosystem is rapidly evolving beyond simple definitions. Today‚Äôs developers and researchers are exploring novel architectures to solve scalability, flexibility, and decentralization trade-offs.

## üß± 1. Monolithic Blockchains

Monolithic chains like **Bitcoin** and **Ethereum (pre-2.0)** handle all core blockchain responsibilities on a single layer:

- **Execution**
- **Consensus**
- **Data availability**
- **Settlement**

**Pros:** Simplicity, strong decentralization  
**Cons:** Poor scalability, bottlenecks under load

---

## üß© 2. Modular Blockchains

Modular blockchains separate core responsibilities across multiple layers or chains.

**Example: Celestia, Ethereum (post-2.0)**

- Execution is handled by rollups
- Data availability provided by a separate layer
- Settlement occurs on a base chain

**Pros:** Scalability, flexibility, parallel development  
**Cons:** Complexity, more trust assumptions

---

## üåê 3. Appchains & Sovereign Chains

These are blockchains optimized for a specific application (e.g., games, DeFi, identity). They may or may not use a modular stack.

**Examples:**

- **Cosmos zones**
- **Polkadot parachains**
- **dYdX Chain (based on Cosmos SDK)**

**Pros:** Custom logic, performance tuning  
**Cons:** Security and bootstrapping overhead

## üîÑ 4. Rollups

Rollups (Optimistic or ZK) execute transactions off-chain and submit compressed proofs to a base chain.

- **Optimistic Rollups:** Assume transactions are valid unless challenged.
- **ZK-Rollups:** Submit validity proofs with each batch.

**Examples:** Arbitrum, Optimism, StarkNet, zkSync

## üß† Conclusion

| Architecture | Focus            | Example  |
| ------------ | ---------------- | -------- |
| Monolithic   | Simplicity       | Bitcoin  |
| Modular      | Scalability      | Celestia |
| Appchain     | Custom apps      | Osmosis  |
| Rollups      | Throughput boost | zkSync   |

Blockchain is no longer one-size-fits-all. Understanding these categories helps you make informed decisions as a developer or architect.
