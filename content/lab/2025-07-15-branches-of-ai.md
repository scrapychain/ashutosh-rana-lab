Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a multidisciplinary domain encompassing several powerful subfields. Each plays a unique role in enabling machines to learn, reason, and act intelligently.

## 🧠 1. Machine Learning (ML)

Teaches machines to learn from data and improve performance without being explicitly programmed.

**Popular branches:**

- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Reinforcement learning

---

## 📄 2. Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language.

**Applications:**

- Chatbots
- Translation
- Sentiment analysis
- Summarization

---

## 👁️ 3. Computer Vision (CV)

Allows systems to derive information from images and video.

**Applications:**

- Object detection
- Image classification
- Facial recognition
- Medical imaging

---

## 🦾 4. Robotics

Combines AI with mechanical systems to perform actions in the real world.

**Subdomains:**

- Motion planning
- Sensor fusion
- Autonomous navigation

---

## 🧠 5. Knowledge Representation & Reasoning (KRR)

Gives AI the ability to store and reason about structured facts.

**Examples:**

- Ontologies
- Semantic web
- Symbolic reasoning

---

## 🔐 6. Multi-Agent Systems

Studies how AI agents interact, collaborate, or compete within environments.

---

## 🧮 7. Neuromorphic Computing

Builds brain-inspired architectures for more efficient AI.
